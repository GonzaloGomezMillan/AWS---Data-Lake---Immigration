# **DATA LAKE - IMMIGRATION IN THE USA**

![](images/immigration_usa.jpg)

## **INTRODUCTION**

The purpose of this project is to create a data lake with data about immigration in the USA and other factors that can be used to carry out different types of analysis. 

With this data lake it would be possible to perform analyses about the number of immigrants arriving in the USA, through which airports they arrive or if the temperatures affect their choice of when to travel to the USA, among many other analyses.

The main difficulty of this analysis is to prepare the data in a way that makes it much easier for data scientists and analysts to extract information, conclusions and predictive models from the data.

## **HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPTS?**

**CREATE AN EMR CLUSTER**

To run this code, it is necessary to create an Amazon EMR (Elastic Map Reduce) cluster. It can be set with the following definition:

After having created the cluster, the notebook can be uploaded and run.

**JUPYTER NOTEBOOK**

The first thing to do is to upload the notebook to the EMR cluster. The Jupyter Notebook has been defined in a way that anyone can choose "Restart and Run All" to run the code.
